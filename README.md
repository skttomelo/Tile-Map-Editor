# Tile-Map-Editor
I know what the name of the project reads and you would be correct in assuming that's what I was trying to make. Essentially I wanted to make a little piece of software I could draw basic tiles on. I wanted these tile maps to be saveable and loadable, so that's what I focused on when doing this. You're able to pick tiles from 1-8 I believe on your keyboard (Don't quote me on that it's been 4+ years) and then using your mouse draw a picture or a map depending on what you are wanting to do. The tiles are drawn on a grid that you can have displayed or invisible depending on how you like to look at the map. When you're done with your drawing you hit new save and to overwrite your current drawing you hit save. I honestly feel that back then I was still working on understanding proper practices to make those two things one button and I just didn't spend the time to combine them. Other than that I had intended to expand on the project with a later idea, but ultimately left it as is and called it finished.
